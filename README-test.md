## Description
This project creates a weather dashboard. The page presents an input field which accepts the name of a city and displays its current day's weather statistics and five day's forecast. The web app also stores previously searched city names and displays them in a list which can be clicked to repeat the search. Weather details are retrieved by calling openweather.org - a public rest api for weather information.
